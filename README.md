### Current Project:
> __MAFIA GAME__
- The game is a popular party game and is sometimes called the *Werewolf*. The game consists of (by default) a moderator/commentator, a mafia, a detective, and a nurse/doctor, and the rest are the bystanders/innocents but does change depending on the number of players.
- The moderator is responsible for the, well, moderation of the game.
- The MAFIA members are responsible for the death of most of the people in the game.
